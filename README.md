# 04-School_District_Analysis

I am behind in the class due to some health issues over the past couple of weeks, I have attempted to reach out to both Nick and Amanda this past week for assistance with getting an accommodation to catch up before I get too far behind, but haven't heard back yet, so I am turning in my partially-completed assignment to not have a zero for this Challenge. 

I understand if I am not able to resubmit/finish this challenge for a new grade but I intend to complete the assignment so I can learn the lesson and would like feedback on my completed assignment even if it does not alter my grade. Is this possible?
